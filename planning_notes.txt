LCGP:
    Taken care of with range_only... & pTrajToWaypoints
    TODO: may need to coordinate timing of reaching waypoints? - Check results to determine this

Solo Range measurements:
    pCommsMgr gets ranges X

Sharing range measurements / GPS:
    pCommsMgr currently handles:
        local est pos for all other agents 'INTERNAL_POS_REPORT'
        local ranges for all 'INTERNAL_RANGE_REPORT'
        local exact pos for self 'INTERNAL_GND_SELF_REPORT'
        local est pos for self 'INTERNAL_EST_SELF_REPORT'

        global ranges for all 'AGENT_RANGE_REPORT'
        global est pos for all 'EST_POS_REPORT'

Localization:
    pLocalize
        Zelazo X - had to use tweaked eq. because the given one
            flew off to inf (problem relating to squared components)

Potential Field Planner:
    verify that waypoint bhv satisfies simple 'go to waypoint' X
    all agents contact each other - handled with pCommsMgr
    pAvoidAgents X
    pAvoidObstacles X
    E Optimality X - check results to verify correct performance
    Combine in a behavior - basic version exists TODO: incorporate speed

Post Processing:
    TODO - figure out what's needed & implement
    TODO - make python script that gets (x,y) postions from alog file and trims the beginning
         - As part of this, make sure the output is the expected input for the existing analysis tools

Feedback:
    Plot E Optimality Metric over time
    Reduce turning radius
    Reduce momentum
    Reduce to 4 agents
    Change environment?
