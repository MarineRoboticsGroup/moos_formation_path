LCGP:
    Taken care of with range_only... & pTrajToWaypoints
    TODO: need to coordinate timing of reaching waypoints?

Solo Range measurements:
    pCommsMgr gets ranges X

Sharing range measurements / GPS:
    pCommsMgr currently handles:
        local exact pos for anchors / self 'INTERNAL_POS_REPORT'
        local ranges for all 'INTERNAL_RANGE_REPORT'
        global pos for anchors 'AGENT_RANGE_REPORT'
        global ranges for all 'ANCHOR_REPORT'

Localization:
    TODO: pLocalize
        Spring solver for first iteration
        Zelazo for second iteration

Potential Field Planner:
    TODO: verify that waypoint bhv satisfies simple 'go to waypoint'
    all agents contact each other - handled with pCommsMgr
    TODO: pAvoidAgents
    pAvoidObstacles - Implemented, have yet to connect to bhv
    TODO: E Optimality
    TODO: Combine in a behavior

Post Processing:
    TODO - figure out what's needed & implement
