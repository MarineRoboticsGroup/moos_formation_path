LCGP:
    Taken care of with range_only... & pTrajToWaypoints
    TODO: may need to coordinate timing of reaching waypoints?

Solo Range measurements:
    pCommsMgr gets ranges X

Sharing range measurements / GPS:
    pCommsMgr currently handles:
        local est pos for all other agents 'INTERNAL_POS_REPORT'
        local ranges for all 'INTERNAL_RANGE_REPORT'
        local exact pos for self 'INTERNAL_GND_SELF_REPORT'
        local est pos for self 'INTERNAL_EST_SELF_REPORT'

        global ranges for all 'AGENT_RANGE_REPORT'
        global est pos for all 'EST_POS_REPORT'

Localization:
    pLocalize
        Zelazo X - had to use tweaked eq. because the given one
            flew off to inf (problem relating to squared components)
        TODO: More robust test with inaccurate ranges, etc.

Potential Field Planner:
    TODO: verify that waypoint bhv satisfies simple 'go to waypoint'
    all agents contact each other - handled with pCommsMgr
    TODO: pAvoidAgents
    pAvoidObstacles - Implemented, have yet to connect to bhv
    TODO: E Optimality
    TODO: Combine in a behavior

Post Processing:
    TODO - figure out what's needed & implement
